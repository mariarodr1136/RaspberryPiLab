# ADC Examples 📟

This section demonstrates how to use the **ADC0834** analog-to-digital converter with the Raspberry Pi. These scripts show how to read analog values from various sensors and control devices like servos, RGB LEDs, and light sensors.

## Included Scripts

* **anIn.py** – Reads analog values from the ADC0834.
* **photon-detect.py** – Reads light intensity from an LDR (photoresistor) via the ADC0834.
* **joyStick.py** – Reads X/Y joystick input and button state using ADC0834.
* **potServo.py** – Uses a potentiometer to control a servo motor’s position.
* **RGBmix.py** – Mixes LED colors based on potentiometer input for each color channel.

## Concepts Covered

* Analog-to-digital conversion
* Reading multiple analog channels
* Measuring sensor data such as light intensity
* PWM-based control using analog input
* Integrating sensors and actuators

## Hardware Needed

* ADC0834 chip
* LDR (photoresistor)
* Potentiometers
* Joystick module
* Servo motor
* RGB LED
* Breadboard and jumper wires
